# TextAdventure
Simple text adventure game akin to Phoenix Wright in text form.

*Still in development.

A simple text adventure game and engine.
  You can create a game by text file, look at the "test game with rooms.txt" for an example.  To do so you must first create any people in the game, then list the rooms, then list each room and what is inside of each room.
  
Things still needing to be added:
  Adding items that can be collected from people or rooms
  Adding dialog from people for items
  Adding a way to use items and what they do
  Adding way to change dialog after talking to someone once?
  Add way to put on easy to Uppercase meaningful words?
